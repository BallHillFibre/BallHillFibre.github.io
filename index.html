                    In September 2019, an enquiry was made to Openreach (OR) to see if it would be possible to
                    obtain broadband over <strong>F</strong>ibre <strong>T</strong>o <strong>T</strong>he <strong>P</strong>remises (FTTP) on Woolton Hill Road in Ball Hill.
                    When Openreach responded to this enquiry in December, they explained that due to the way
                    their network is configured, there are circa 100 properties that could receive FTTP on the
                    network leg supplying the properties on the original enquiry. </br></br>
                    OR have a scheme for community fibre projects (CFP) to install fibre in rural areas that are
                    not already on the roll-out plan for new fibre networks. This scheme is supported by funding
                    from central government via the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and in
                    Hampshire by Hampshire County Council. The funding for residential properties, from the
                    two schemes, amounts to £3,000 per property; for SMEs, funding is only available from
                    DCMS and amounts to £3,500. </br></br>
                    The intention of this project is to engage with Openreach to install a new fibre network to
                    cover circa 100 properties with the full cost of the installation to be covered by vouchers so
                    there is no installation cost to residents/SME owners. </br></br>
                    Once the network is installed, each home owner/SME owner would contract with their
                    preferred broadband service provider (ISP) to provide a service over the fibre network.

                                    We are still canvassing residents to determine the level of interest. A number of
                                    people have said they are keen to pursue the scheme. In order to fund the scheme entirely
                                    from government and local authority funded vouchers, we need a few more properties to take

                                    It is also possible that FTTP will increase the value of your home if you are thinking of selling.

                                    FTTP (<strong>F</strong>ibre <strong>T</strong>o <strong>T</strong>he <strong>P</strong>remises) is a new technology that can replace your existing broadband connection infrastructure. The majority of properties receive broadband over the copper telephone line, either on copper all the way to the exchange or on copper to a local cabinet and from their over fibre to the exchange. FTTP replaces the copper connection to properties with a fibre connection all the way from the property to the exchange. As fibre doesn't degrade the speed over distance and isn't subject to the same kind of interference problems as copper you should see a faster and more reliable service.

                                    The speed to each individual property will be dependent upon which ISP you decide to use and which package you sign up to, but typically an ISP will offer a range of speeds, at different prices, from 36Mbps to 900Mbps.

                                    OR have proposed to implement a “Demand Led” project for the installation of the new fibre network, in a Demand Led project all of the costs are covered by vouchers from central government (via DCMS) and county councils. </br></br>
                                    When residents / SMEs pledge their vouchers to the scheme they are committing to contracting with a broadband service provider to take out an FTTP based service within 2 months of the new fibre network going live. The speed of the new connection must be at least twice the speed of the existing connection. The terms of the voucher scheme can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gigabitvoucher.culture.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-08-GBVS-Beneficiary-Terms-and-Conditions-v6.0.pdf">here</a>. </br></br>
                                    In an OR “Demand Led” Community Fibre Project an outline of the process is:</br></br>

                                        An enquiry is made to Openreach for a number of properties <em>(September 2020)</em>. </br></br>
                                        Openreach respond with an offer and an outline cost for the project and provide details of the properties that are included in the cost which may be different to the properties initially included in the enquiry <em>(Dec 2020)</em>. </br></br>
                                        If this is of interest OR will request a final cost for the project which is a more detailed costing and typically is not significantly different to the outline cost but it could be <em>(Jan 2021)</em>. </br></br>
                                        If the project is still acceptable to those wishing to take part OR will ask DCMS/Hampshire County Council to allocate vouchers to this scheme. </br></br>
                                        OR then setup a webpage for the project on which residents can “pledge” their vouchers to the scheme. The details for how to do this will be provided in due course. </br></br>
                                        When sufficient vouchers are pledged to cover the cost the work will begin. </br></br>
                                        Vouchers are paid direct to OR on completion of the installation. </br></br>
                                        When the network is live residents can place a contract for a new fibre based broadband service from a number of different suppliers, see list below. The voucher scheme requires customers to purchase a service with a minimum speed of 30 Mbps, but it should be more than twice the speed of the existing connection.

                                    This depends on who you use now for your email service. Email services such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, etc are independent of the broadband service provider. If, for example, BT is your service provider and you use BT email addresses, changing service provider might affect your email service – in this instance, you would need to check with BT what the impact on your email would be. Each broadband provider will have different conditions and therefore it is necessary to check for your own circumstances.

                                    You will still be able to keep your existing telephone service over the existing copper connection and, in this scenario, your telephone number would not change.</br></br>
                                    However, depending upon the service you select, it might include a telephony service known as <strong>V</strong>oice <strong>O</strong>ver <strong>IP</strong> (VoIP). If it does, you can choose to cancel your existing telephone service and move the existing number across to the new service. It is similar to keeping your mobile number when changing mobile service suppliers.</br></br>
                                    There is a third option whereby you can decide to contract with a company that only provides VoIP services rather than obtaining telephony from your broadband supplier.</br></br>
                                    We would each need to decide for ourselves how we wish to deal with this, though I would hope that once someone has identified the details of the VoIP options, they would share the information with all of us.

                                    No. Once the installation is completed, the only change that you should notice is that the service will be faster and more reliable. The new router will require setting up and the wifi name and password configuring. If it is possible to change the router name, it can be simpler to set the new router to the same name and password as the old router and then all wifi connected devices will connect to the new router straight away.

                                    No, there should be no building work necessary within your property. At most, you will need a hole drilled for the new fibre connection and a new box installed on the wall in which the fibre is terminated. Your new fibre router, which will be supplied by your ISP, will connect to the box. It also requires power, so it must be located near an electrical socket. In the future, services like TV and telephony may be delivered using the fibre termination box so think carefully where will be most convenient to install it. The fibre termination box is fixed to the wall to help protect the fibre.

                                    There are various options to address this: you can either run both your existing service overlapping your new service or, if you are staying with your existing ISP, they will ensure that the service moves without interruption.
